                    The Burger King menu in India would be totally different from its offerings world over, however they
                    decided
                    not to change their most famous product – flame grilling their patties. Their best burger ‘The Big
                    whopper’
                    couldn’t be served with the standard beef patty but in India their chicken and mutton patties would
                    be
                    flame
                    grilled and offered to customers.
                    In a country where religion defines food choices, Burger King realised that and worked on their
                    vegetarian
                    menu even before their launch. They decided to offer multiple reasons for vegetarian customers to
                    also
                    come
                    back to them. They offered options such as Crispy Veg Burger, Paneer King Burger, Spicy Bean Royale,
                    etc
                    which took care of their criteria – crispy, spicy and juicy.
                    Burger King in India weekly offers you can take advantage of to save money. For example, if you
                    stuck
                    for
                    breakfast, an example offer you could get would be there King Egg Burger – 2 for ₹69.00. As well,
                    some
                    longer running Burger King offers include their Crispy Chicken Burger – 2 for ₹79.00 and their
                    Crispy
                    Veg
                    Burger – 2 for ₹59.00.
                    Lastly, Burger King has been long running partners with the Mumbai Indians and are always running
                    offers
                    with their cricket team.

                    <h3 class="cont_head">Best Burgers On Menu</h3>
                    Of course, Burger King’s most famous and most delicious burger is their whopper. A standard on the
                    Burger
                    King menu is the Chicken Whopper, the Mutton Whopper, and the Vegetarian Whopper.
                    In addition to their traditional whoppers, they also add in special edition whoppers. One of the new
                    variations they’ve recently added in has been the Masala Whopper
                    It’s the traditional whopper with a special Masala sauce and a few more extras thrown in.
                    Now, the whopper burger may be a bit big for some people, so you can also choose from some smaller
                    burgers
                    on the menu. Some of these could include the Chicken Tandoor Grill Burger, the BK Grill Chicken
                    Burger,
                    and
                    the Chicken Chilli Cheese Burger – all great additions to Burger King’s menu in India.

                    <h3 class="cont_head">Burger King Menu Combos</h3>
                    They have the Whopper Combo Vegetarian and Non-Vegetarian, which includes the burger with their
                    fries
                    and a
                    Pepsi. They also have special combo offers during particular festivals or sporting seasons. Their
                    most
                    popular burgers are Mutton Whopper, Chicken Whopper, Whopper Meal, Fried Cheese Burger, Crispy
                    Chicken
                    Burger, Onion Rings, Veg Chilli Cheese Melt, Crispy Veg Supreme and Crispy Veg Burger.
                    Unlike the KFC menu or the Domino’s menu, the only type of combos available on the Burger King menu
                    is
                    getting a burger with fries and a drink. That’s because those are the only food items they serve. If
                    they
                    expanded their menu and included more varieties of food, you would find different types of combos
                    available
                    at Burger King.

                    Burger King is the second largest fast food hamburger chain in the world. It operates close to
                    13,000
                    restaurants in 100 countries. The Burger King menu is the original ‘Home of The Whopper’ and has
                    been
                    making
                    burgers since 1954. In the year 2010 Burger King Corporation was purchased by 3G Capital.
                    Everstone Group in India which managed restaurants such as Copper Chimney, Noodle Bar and Bombay
                    Blue
                    started talks with Burger Kings Holdings Inc. in 2013. The 2 companies decided to launch the brand
                    in
                    India
                    as a joint venture. 3G capital wanted to expand since it took over in 2010 and Everstone could help
                    get
                    the
                    right locations.
                    Rajeev Varman, Burger King’s General Manager in North West Europe was made to head the India
                    operations.
                    He
                    along with others at Evershine Group travelled the length and breadth of India to understand
                    consumer
                    taste
                    and mentality. They realised they needed to make their Indian Burger King menu 70% Vegetarian and
                    have
                    crunchy and spicy options on their menu.
                    Their first store opened in Select City Walk, in New Delhi in 2014 followed by a store in Mumbai in
                    High
                    Street Phoenix. Over the next year they decided to open 10 stores but only in Mumbai and Delhi.
                    Burger
                    King
                    has a differentiated offering and decided to do a slow and steady ramp up.
                    Burger King’s restaurants are available in most of the popular malls and food courts all around
                    Bandalore,
                    Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Deli, and many more areas.
